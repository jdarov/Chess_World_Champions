# ♛ Chess World Champions ♚  
*Where Classic Chess Meets Card-Based Chaos*

Welcome to **Chess World Champions** — a revolutionary reimagining of the timeless game of chess! This project combines the elegance of chess with the unpredictability and power-ups of a card-based mechanic, creating a unique PvP experience like no other.

## 🚀 Project Status

🎯 **Current Phase**: MVP Development  
🧠 **Technologies**: Python (core game logic), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (web frontend), JSON (deck storage), and NFT integration (coming soon)

---

## 🔥 Core Concept

Chess World Champions blends traditional chess with **collectible cards** that alter gameplay dynamics. Each player gets:

- ♟ **A standard chessboard and pieces**
- 🃏 **A deck of 10 cards**
- 🎴 **A hand of 3 cards** drawn at the start of the match
- 🔁 On each turn, the player can **move a piece OR play/draw a card**

Cards influence gameplay by:
- Modifying piece movement  
- Changing board state  
- Triggering traps or boosts  
- Offering powerful one-time effects  

---

## 📜 Rules & Mechanics

- 🧩 **Turn Structure**:
  1. Choose to **move** a piece *or* **play/draw** a card
  2. Cards can only be played during your turn
  3. Victory is by **checkmate**

---

## 🧬 NFT Integration (Coming Soon)

Each chess piece will be backed by a unique NFT from the upcoming **Chess World Champions NFT Collection**:

- 🔗 **10,000 NFTs**  
- 🎨 Each piece has:
  - 3 unique traits (e.g., Armor, Weapon, Secondary (shield, dual-wield, spell, etc))  
  - Rarity tiers (Common → Legendary)  
- 💎 Owning NFTs will unlock **exclusive cards**, **visual skins**, and **legendary perks** in-game  

---

## 🌐 Website & Web App (Coming Soon)

A dynamic front-end experience is in the works! Planned features:

- 🖥️ Play matches in browser (React.js)  
- 💼 Connect wallet for NFT holders  
- 🏆 Ranked multiplayer & matchmaking (v2)  
- 🧾 Deck customization for power users

## 📅 Roadmap

- ✅ Build MVP core logic (chess + card draw/play)  
- ⏳ Launch static site + deploy rules  
- 🔜 Release 10-card starter deck  
- 🔜 Publish NFT collection (OpenSea)  
- 🔜 Web multiplayer support (v2)

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### 🧮 Scoring Alternative (Optional Mode - Post MVP)

A capture-based points system as a win condition:

- Pawn: 1 pt  
- Knight/Bishop: 3 pts  
- Rook: 5 pts  
- Queen: 9 pts  
- **First to 20 points wins** (if checkmate isn’t achieved)

This mode would allow shorter, faster-paced games with strategic aggression.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> "Chess is a war over the board. The object is to crush the opponent’s mind."  
> *— Bobby Fischer*

We’re taking that war to a whole new battlefield. 💥  
Join the revolution.
